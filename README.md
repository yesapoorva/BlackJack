Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The game's objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it. Aces can be counted as 1 or 11, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) as 10, and the remaining cards at their face value.
